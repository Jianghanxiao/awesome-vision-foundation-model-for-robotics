# 🚀 **Awesome Vision Foundation Models for Robotics**
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> ✨ A curated list of **Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)** that empower **robot learning** and **robot perception** with strong **zero-shot generalization**.

---

## 🎯 **Why This List?**
Robotics research keeps evolving — and so do vision foundation models trained on **huge datasets** with **broad generalization** skills.  
But… 🤯 finding the right model for **your specific robotic task** is hard.

So this repo serves as:

✅ A **dictionary** of VFMs for robotics  
✅ A **quick lookup** for papers & code  
✅ A **task-driven map** for integration into pipelines  
✅ A community-driven reference to stay **up-to-date**

---

## 🧩 **What Counts as a Vision Foundation Model?**
A model that:

- ✅ Supports **vision tasks**
- ✅ Shows **zero-shot / few-shot** generalization
- ✅ Has **practical value** for robot perception & interaction 🤖

> If there is **no code** → 🚫 **not included**.

> 💡 Broad definition: If it advances **robot vision** with **practical benefit**, it’s welcome here.
